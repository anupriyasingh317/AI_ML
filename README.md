This python code will output the documents which are most expected to be searched by keyword or search word.
In this python code the approach i followed is
#1 uploading the text documents in first place
#2 Extracting the text content and their doc names as label from all documents and forming the corpus data.
#3 processing the text---> performing tokenization, punctuation removing, stopwords, stemming etc...
#4 calculating TF-IDF , cosine similarity...
#5 searching query word and displaying most related doc at first.
